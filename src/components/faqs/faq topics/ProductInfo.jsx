  //     question: "ARE YOUR CANS RECYCLABLE?",
  //     answer:
  //       "Yes, our cans are infinitely recyclable. In fact, of all the aluminum produced since 1888, 75% of it is still currently in use. Compare that to plastic which basically isn't recycled anymore because it's simply not profitable. #DeathToPlastic",

(Only our Iced Teas contain a microdose of 30mg of caffeine. Check with your doc if you have questions about caffeine.)",
  //   },
  //   {
  //     question: "WHAT IS THE SHELF LIFE OF LIQUID DEATH?",
  //     answer:
  //       "For technical reasons, the shelf life is pegged at 24 months. So you can definitely use it for your doomsday prep if that's what you're asking. ðŸ’€",
